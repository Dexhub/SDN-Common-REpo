\section{\ArchName Network Management}
\label{sec:system}

In this section, we focus on the design of a {\em datacenter
  management layer} that uses building blocks from previous sections,
to implement a \blue{feasible} reconfigurable datacenter network.
%
We start with describing the high-level roles of the different
components of the management layer. See Figure~\ref{fig:mgmt}.

\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\bf Monitoring Engine (ME):} ME provides network status
  information (e.g., links status, traffic patterns, or views
of ``elephant'' flows~\cite{hedera,devoflow,conext13ericson})
to the management layer. 

\item {\bf Optimization Engine (OE):} Given the offered traffic
  workload, a pre-configured flexible topology (PCFT), and the current
  network state (e.g., link status), the optimization engine devises
  an efficient {\em reconfiguration and traffic engineering strategy}
  so as to optimize desired performance goals.

\item {\bf Data Plane Translation Engine (DPE):} DPE translates the
  OE output into an efficient data plane strategy.

\item {\bf Application APIs:} APIs enable the users/tenants to inform
    application details (e.g., expected traffic patterns,
    single/multi-path TCP) to the optimization and data plane modules,
    \blue{to best leverage the benefits of \ArchName.}
\end{packeditemize}

\softpara{Plan.} For the ME, we will leverage past work on scalable 
traffic matrix and elephant flow
detection~\cite{hedera,devoflow,yingzhangconext13}.  Similarly, we
will extend prior work on APIs for applications to expose traffic
patterns~\cite{coflow,bigdatahotsdn}.
%
We address OE and DTE in the following subsections. In the last
subsection, we address design of a wireless out-of-band control
network for configuration dissemination and data collection.
