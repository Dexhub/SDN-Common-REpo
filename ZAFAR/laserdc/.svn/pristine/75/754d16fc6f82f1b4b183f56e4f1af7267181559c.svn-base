1. CFLAGS -03/04 to speed up?

2. move debug to config.h and add ifdef debug to main.cpp

3. add the cleanup_clock.h/.cpp files

4. add the destructor function for the TcpSrc and TcpSink classes? -- not much to do here

5. add the priority queue of TCPSrcesToDelete -- rather than directly deleting TcpSrc/Sink structures 

6. add flow label into the packet class ..

7. change _tcps structure to be a set of active flows instead of everything 

8. change the network and rexmit timer functions to look up deleted flow list
