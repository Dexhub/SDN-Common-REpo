Assume, only 1 FSO per rack. Each FSO acts as a sender as well as a receiver.

Let the inter-rack traffic be t_{ij} between rack i and j. Let t_ij's be
integers.

	VS: how much does integrality hurt us -- answer from himanshu additive factor of 1?

Assume the bandwidth of each link to be 1. I.e., one unit of traffic takes
one unit of time.

Let $T$ be the best evacuation time.

It is easy to see that:

SUM_i t_ij <= T	  (because the receiver j can only receive one unit of traffic in a unit time)
SUM_j t_ij <= T   (because the sender i can only send one unit of traffic in a unit time)


Assume n racks. Now, consider a bi-partite graph of n senders and n receivers. 
Draw t_ij edges beween sender i and receiver j in the graph. The maximum degree
of a node in this graph is T. Thus, based on the Hall's theorem, the edges can
be partitioned into at most T machings. 

	VS: not clear  this is really bipartite since each node is both sender and receiver
	VS: do the halls theorem etc work on such graphs with multiedges? 
	VS: need to model the fact that  things are duplex at each unit time, that is not captured here in a general matching

Each matching represents a depletion of edges (unit traffic) in unit time, 
where each sender talks to only one receiver and vice-versa. So, the total
completion time is at most T.

Thus, the optimal (T) is achievable using one-hop traffic and matchings.

	VS: if we consider things that are not evacuation (e.g., traffic is continuously arriving?), then does multi hop help us?
	e.g., going back to my original example, if we have 	
		R1 --> R2 50 Kbps demand, R2 --> R3 50 Kbps demand, R1 --> R3 50 Kbps demand, and any FSO link will be able to give 100Kbps capacity
		then optimal seems to be to setup R1->R2 and R2->R3 links and use R1->R2->R3 multihop link?
		(i feel there is some implicit assumption about the demand/buffering at switches somewhere in the proof, but i cant quite pinpoint where)

GENERALIZATION to m FSOs per rack. 
==============

Let $T$ be the best evacuation time. 

FIRST: For each (i,j), MAKE the SMALLER of the two values t_{ij} and t_{ji} ZERO. 

	VS: why are we doing this, is this for the duplex bit?

Now, observe that: 

SUM_i t_ij <= mT
SUM_j t_ij <= mT

You can mT number of matchings. Each set of m matching corresponds to a valid
depletion of edges in ONE unit of time (since we have m senders and m receivers
at each rack). 

The ignored (t_ij or t_ji) traffic can be accomodated/piggybacked on the corresponding
reverse traffic. 

	VS: would the link have the capacity to do that, how do we know that there is sufficient capacity?

Thus, achievable in T unit times.


HALL's Theorem
==============

Consider a bi-partite graph, wherein the maximum degree is r. Then, the edges 
can be partitioned into at most r matchings.

This follows from the well-known theorem which says that if the bi-partite graph
is r-regular, then the edges can be partitioned into r perfect matchings.
