\section{Case for flexibility}

\begin{itemize}

\item introduce abstract model of DC design 

\item different toy workloads 

\item flexibility eliminates wired core, reduces num switches/links 

\item other qualitative benefits  -- e.g., elastic tree, airflow etc

\item challenge -- how to realize this --  wiring will be a pain, algorithms
will be a pain, reconfig will be a pain

\end{itemize}
