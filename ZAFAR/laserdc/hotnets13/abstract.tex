We explore the vision of an \emph{all-wireless inter-rack datacenter
fabric}.  Such a  fabric, if realized, can offer operator
 the ability to dynamically reconfigure the network topology
to adapt to future traffic demands while eliminating concerns related
 to cabling complexity. A key enabler for our vision is the use of free
space optical (FSO) technology which, in contrast to traditional
wireless/RF technologies, has lower interference footprint,
can support longer range, and offers higher bandwidths.
While FSO is  an enabler, there are
several significant practical challenges that need to be addressed
before this vision turns into reality. We demonstrate the early
promise of addressing these challenges and the potential benefits that
this offers in comparison to state-of-the-art datacenter architectures.
