ABSTRACT="This paper introduces and analyzes a class of nonlinear
congestion control algorithms called binomial algorithms, motivated in
part by the needs of streaming audio and video applications for which a
drastic reduction in transmission rate upon congestion is problematic.
Binomial algorithms generalize TCP-style additive-increase by increasing
inversely proportional to a power k of the current window (for TCP,
k=0); they generalize TCP-style multiplicative-decrease by decreasing
proportional to a power l of the current window (for TCP, l=1).  We show
that there are an infinite number of deployable TCP-friendly binomial
algorithms, all of which satisfy k+l=1, and that all binomial algorithms
converge to fairness under a synchronized-feedback assumption provided
k+l > 0; k, l >= 0.  Our simulation results show that binomial
algorithms interact well with TCP across a RED bottleneck gateway.  We
focus on two particular algorithms, IIAD
(inverse-increase/additive-decrease, k=1, l=0) and SQRT (k=l=0.5),
showing that they are well-suited to applications that do not react well
to large TCP-style window reductions.  We also find that
TCP-friendliness in terms of the relationship between throughput and
loss rate of an algorithm does not necessarily imply fairness relative
to TCP performance, especially for drop-tail bottleneck gateways.",

ABSTRACT="Reliable transport protocols such as TCP are tuned to perform
well in traditional networks where packet losses occur mostly because of
congestion. However, networks with wireless and other lossy links also
suffer from significant losses due to bit errors and handoffs. TCP
responds to all losses by invoking congestion control and avoidance
algorithms, resulting in degraded end-to-end performance in wireless and
lossy systems. In this paper, we compare several schemes designed to
improve the performance of TCP in such networks. We classify these
schemes into three broad categories: end-to-end protocols, where loss
recovery is performed by the sender; link-layer protocols that provide
local reliability; and split-connection protocols that break the
end-to-end connection into two parts at the base station. We present the
results of several experiments performed in both LAN and WAN
environments, using throughput and goodput as the metrics for
comparison. Our results show that a reliable link-layer protocol that is
TCP-aware provides very good performance. Furthermore, it is possible to
achieve good performance without splitting the end-to-end connection at
the base station. We also demonstrate that selective acknowledgments and
explicit loss notifications result in significant performance
improvements.",

ABSTRACT="The current generation of protocol architectures, such as
TCP/IP or the ISO suite, seem successful at meeting the demands of
todays networks. However, a number of new requirements have been
proposed for the networks of tomorrow, and some innovation in protocol
structuring may be necessary. In this paper, we review some key
requirements for tomorrow's networks, and propose some architectural
principles to structure a new generation of protocols. In particular,
this paper identifies two new design principles, Application Level
Framing and Integrated Layer Processing. Additionally, it identifies the
presentation layer as a key aspect of overall network performance.",

ABSTRACT="We discuss gateway queueing algorithms and their role in
controlling congestion in datagram networks. A fair queueing algorithm,
based on an earlier suggestion by Nagle, is proposed. Analysis and
simulations are used to compare this algorithm to other congestion
control schemes. We find that fair queueing provides several important
advantages over the usual first-come-first-serve queueing algorithm:
fair allocation of bandwidth, lower delay for sources using less than
their full share of bandwidth, and protection from ill-behaved sources.",

YEAR=1994,

REFERENCES=18,
ABSTRACT="This paper discusses the use of Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN) mechanisms in the TCP/IP protocol.  The first part
proposes new guidelines for TCP's response to ECN mechanisms (e.g.,
Source Quench packets, ECN fields in packet headers).  Next, using
simulations, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of ECN in TCP/IP
networks.  Our simulations use RED gateways modified to set an ECN bit
in the IP packet header as an indication of congestion, with Reno-style
TCP modified to respond to ECN as well as to packet drops as indications
of congestion.  The simulations show that one advantage of ECN
mechanisms is in avoiding unnecessary packet drops, and therefore
avoiding unnecessary delay for packets from low-bandwidth
delay-sensitive TCP connections.  A second advantage of ECN mechanisms
is in networks (generally LANs) where the effectiveness of TCP
retransmit timers is limited by the coarse granularity of the TCP clock.
The paper also discusses some implementation issues concerning specific
ECN mechanisms in TCP/IP networks.", ENTRYBY=Sc }

ABSTRACT="This document specifies TCP-Friendly Rate Control (TFRC). TFRC
is a congestion control mechanism for unicast flows operating in a
best-effort {I}nternet environment.  It is reasonably fair when competing
for bandwidth with TCP flows, but has a much lower variation of
throughput over time compared with TCP, making it more suitable for
applications such as telephony or streaming media where a relatively
smooth sending rate is of importance.",

ABSTRACT="In this paper we show that application-aware adaptation, a
collaborative partnership between the operating system and applications,
offers the most general and effective approach to mobile information
access.  We describe the design of Odyssey, a prototype implementing
this approach, and show how it supports concurrent execution of diverse
mobile applications.  We identify agility as a key attribute of adaptive
systems, and describe how to quantify and measure it.  We present the
results of our evaluation of Odyssey, indicating performance
improvements up to a factor of 5 on a benchmark of three applications
concurrently using remote services over a network with highly variable
bandwidth.",

ABSTRACT="The steady-state performance of a bulk transfer TCP flow
(i.e., a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP
transfers) may be characterized by the send rate, which is the amount of
data sent by the sender in unit time. In this paper we develop a simple
analytic characterization of the steady-state send rate as a function of
loss rate and round trip time (RTT) for a bulk transfer TCP flow. Unlike
the models in [7]-[9], and [12], our model captures not only the
behavior of the fast retransmit mechanism but also the effect of the
time-out mechanism. Our measurements suggest that thi8s latter behavior
is important from a modeling perspective, as almost all of our TCP
traces contained more time-out events than fast retransmit events. Our
measurements demonstrate that our model is able to more accurately
predict TCP send rate and is accurate over a wider range of loss rates.
We also present a simple extension of our model to compute the
throughput of a bulk transfer TCP flow, which is defined as the amount
of data received by the receiver in unit time.",

ABSTRACT="We investigate the problem of providing a fair bandwidth
allocation to each of n flows that share the outgoing link of a
congested router. The buffer at the outgoing link is a simple FIFO,
shared by packets belonging to the n flows. We devise a simple packet
dropping scheme, called CHOKe, that discriminates against the flows
which submit more packets/sec than is allowed by their fair share. By
doing this, the scheme aims to approximate the fair queueing policy.
Since it is stateless and easy to implement, CHOKe controls unresponsive
or misbehaving flows with a minimum overhead.",

ABSTRACT="An ad-hoc network is the cooperative engagement of a
collection of Mobile Hosts without the required intervention of any
centralized Access Point.  In this paper we present an innovative design
for the operation of such ad-hoc networks.  The basic idea of the design
is to operate each Mobile Host as a specialized router, which
periodically advertises its view of the interconnection topology with
other Mobile Hosts within the network.  This amounts to a new sort of
routing protocol.  We have investigated modifications of the basic
Bellman-Ford routing mechanisms, as specified by RIP, to make it
suitable for a dynamic and self-starting network mechanism as is
required by users wishing to utilize ad-hoc networks.  Our modifications
address some of the previous objections to the use of Bellman-Ford,
related to the poor looping properties of such algorithms in the face of
broken links and the resulting time dependent nature of the
interconnection topology describing the links between the Mobile Hosts.
Finally, we describe the ways in which the basic network-layer routing
can be modified to provide MAC-layer suppoort for ad-hoc networks.",

ABSTRACT="We propose a scheme for congestion avoidance in networks using
a connectionless protocol at the network layer. The scheme uses a
minimal amount of feedback from the network to the users, who adjust the
amount of traffic allowed into the network. The routers in the network
detect congestion and set a congestion-indication bit on packets flowing
in the forward direction. The congestion indication is communicated back
to the users through the transport-level acknowledgement. The scheme is
distributed, adapts to the dynamic state of the network, converges to
the optimal operating point, is quite simple to implement, and has low
overhead. The scheme maintains fairness in service provided to multiple
sources. This paper presents the schme and the analysis that went into
the choice of the various decision mechanisms. We also address the
performance of the scheme under transient changes in the network and
pathological overload conditions.",

abstract="Zona game system.     
Zona aims to take online gaming to the next level
January 17, 2002 

Servers for so-called massively multiplayer online games--in which
thousands of people congregate in a shared virtual world--are in a
surprisingly sorry state. Although the market research firm IDC
expects the online-gaming market to be worth \$2.3 billion by 2005, an
increase of 570 percent over 2001, today's gaming servers are
expensive to maintain, inflexible, and prone to crash. Most online
games get stuck at about 6,000 players per server, and players on one
server can't talk to those on another, reducing the appeal of an
online-gaming community.

Zona's founders say their system can pack 32,000 players onto one
server and can cut dramatically the cost of the computing power
required to support each additional player. Zona estimates its product
will cost companies \$4.50 per additional player; other game publishers
face costs of more than \$100 per player. Furthermore, players on
different servers can communicate with one another, and when one
server goes down, the system will shift players to a new server
without disconnecting them. "

AUTHOR="Scott Shenker",
TITLE="Fundamental Design Issues for the Future {I}nternet",
JOURNAL=ieeejsac,
MONTH=sep,
YEAR=1995,
VOLUME=13,
NUMBER=7,
ABSTRACT="The {I}nternet has been a startling and dramatic success.
Originally designed to link together a small group of researchers,
the {I}nternet now is used by millions of people. However, with multimedia
applications, with their novel traffic characteristics and service
requirements, pose an interesting challenge to the technical foundations
of the {I}nternet. In this paper we address some of the fundamental
architectural design issues facing the future {I}nternet. In particular,
we discuss whether the {I}nternet should adopt a new service model,
how this service model should be invoked, and whether this service
model should include admission control. These architecture issues
are discussed in a non rigorous manner, through the use of a utility
function formulation and some simple models. While we do advocate
some design choices over others, the main purpose here is to provide
a framework for discussing the various architectural alternatives.",

TITLE="General {AIMD} Congestion Control",
INSTITUTION="University of Texas",

TYPE="Technical Report",
MONTH=may,
YEAR=2000,
NUMBER="UTCS TR-2000-09",
ABSTRACT="Instead of the increase-by-one decrease-to-half strategy used
in TCP Reno for congestion window adjustment, we consider the general
case such that the increase value and decrease ratio are parameters.
That is, in the congestion avoidance state, the window size is increased
by $\alpha$ per window of packets acknowledged and it is decreased to
$\beta$ of the current value when there is congestion indication.  We
refer to this window adjustment strategy as {\em general additive
increase multiplicative decrease} (GAIMD).  We present the (mean)
sending rate of a GAIMD flow as a function of $\alpha$, $\beta$, loss
rate, mean round-trip time, mean timeout value, and the number of
packets acknowledged by each ACK.  We conducted extensive experiments to
validate this sending rate formula.  We found the formula to be quite
accurate for a loss rate of up to 20\%.  We also present in this paper a
simple relationship between $\alpha$ and $\beta$ for a GAIMD flow to be
{\em TCP-friendly}, that is, for the GAIMD flow to have approximately
the same sending rate as a TCP flow under the same path conditions.  We
present results from simulations in which TCP-friendly GAIMD flows
($\alpha = 0.31$, $\beta = 7/8$) compete for bandwidth with TCP Reno
flows and with TCP SACK flows, on a DropTail link as well as on a RED
link.  We found that the GAIMD flows were highly TCP-friendly.
Furthermore, with $\beta$ at 7/8 instead of 1/2, these GAIMD flows have
reduced rate fluctuations compared to TCP flows.",
