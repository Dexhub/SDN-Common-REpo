\section{running list of concerns}

\begin{itemize}

\item algos seem ad hoc -- no specificiation of
requirements/objective/optimality  

\item can we run stuff fast enough -- i.e. reconf algos take less than 1 ms 
 even for 500 node topologies? 

\item do we have the inputs we need -- flow size or elephants?

\item can we really beat cthru 3db etc

\item what workloads are bad?

\item what update sequences are bad?

\item are we doing pure sm or hybrid? if so how to do budgeted optimization here?

\item how much do mininet, fs, htsim scale?

\end{itemize}
