5.1 Plan
====

** PCT vs. RC. 	[Greedy in PCT -- … confirm with matroid…

 non-splittable flows. Min congestion. NPC (mc or others).
	PCT vs RC: Flows given, TE related objectives, given a non-complete graph …. Latency plays important role.
	ILP is very slow.
	Relationship with Network Design … 	
. Approaches:
	. Aggregate, and make it splittable. 
***	. Approximation: Greedy won't work?? We'll try (a) randomizing, (b) Iterative Routing
	. Relax the assumption of traffic predictability: Online ……
	. When to reconfigure?? 
	. Local Reconfiguration??

. Graph extraction -- Steiner tree.
. 1 SM/FSO. No selection. Exactly as min-congestion problem
. 1 FSO/

\eat{\para{Flexible Topology.} Essentially, each rack has a certain number
of FSOs, and each FSO is associated with a set of other FSOs
(typically from other and different racks) that it can {\em
  potentially} ``connect'' to by a {\em full-duplex} link.  These
associations are determined by pre-alignment of SMs or the GM of the
FSOs, and hence may be limited in number and area.
%
In any case, at any instant, each FSO is connected to at most one
other FSO, chosen in real-time from the set of associated FSOs.
