\section{\ArchName Network Management}
\label{sec:system}

In this section, we focus on the design of a {\em datacenter
  management layer} that uses building blocks from previous sections,
to implement a \blue{feasible} reconfigurable datacenter network.
%
We start with describing the high-level roles of the different
components of the management layer. See Figure~\ref{fig:mgmt}.

\begin{packeditemize}
\item {\bf Monitoring Engine (ME):} ME provides network status
  information to the management layer. E.g., it provides (i) status of
  individual inter-FSO links, (ii) measurements of observed traffic
  patterns such as inter-rack {\em traffic matrix}) or views of
  ``elephant'' flows~\cite{hedera,devoflow,conext13ericson}.

\item {\bf Optimization Engine (OE):} Given the offered traffic
  workload, a pre-configured flexible topologies (PCTF), and the
  current network state (e.g., active links and link status), the
  optimization engine devises an efficient {\em reconfiguration and
    traffic engineering strategy} so as to achieve desired performance
  goals (e.g., throughput, latency).

\item {\bf Data Plane Translation Engine (DPE):} DPE translates the
  output of the optimization engine into a data plane strategy.

\item {\bf Application APIs:} The management layer also provides APIs
  to the users/tenants to best leverage the benefits of
  reconfigurability. \blue{E.g., users can use APIs to inform relevant
    application details (e.g., expected traffic patterns,
    single/multi-path TCP) to the optimization and data plane
    modules.}
\end{packeditemize}

\eat{
\softpara{Challenges.} In designing the \ArchName management layer, we
build on traditional cloud and network management including traffic
engineering~\cite{}, software-defined networking~\cite{}, fast routing
recovery~\cite{}, and managing network updates~\cite{}. The key
differences from these prior works arise on three dimensions. First,
prior traffic engineering efforts typically assumes the network
(topology) to be {\em static}, whereas the \ArchName network is
inherently {\em dynamic}. This gives rise to new challenges and
opportunities for topology reconfiguration, traffic engineering, and
data plan strategies. Second, constraints imposed by the free-space
optics (e.g., reconfiguration latency) and pre-configured topologies
give rise to unique challenges w.r.t\ connectivity and performance
guarantees during reconfigurations, which falls outside the scope of
prior recovery and configuration schemes.
%
Third, prior SDN proposals assume a ``control network'' (typically
out-of-band) for managing the network devices~\cite{emulab,ethane}.
\blue{In our vision of an ``all wireless'' fabric, this assumption no
  longer holds.}}

\softpara{Plan.} In the following susections, we address OE, DTE, and the
control channel implementation, respectively. For the ME, we will
leverage past work on scalable traffic matrix and elephant flow
detection~\cite{hedera,devoflow,yingzhangconext13}.  Similarly, we
will extend prior work on abstractions for applications to expose
their traffic patterns~\cite{coflow,bigdatahotsdn}. For clarity, we
describe the OE and DTE componentns \blue{assuming that we have an
out-of-band control network for configuration dissemination and data
collection}, and relax this assumption later.
